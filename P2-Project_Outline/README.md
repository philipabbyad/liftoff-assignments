# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Volunteer Organizer App: This is an app where users can sign-up to volunteer for events created by organizations. Users will find this useful as both volunteers and organizations will be able to  list, search, create and contact events/volunteers as well as build profiles and review users.

This idea came from the need for relevant volunteer opportunities to be easily visible to potential volunteers.

### Features

<ul>
    <li>User Authentication/Authorization: Users can sign-up as Organizations or Volunteers to create profile and login</li>
    <li>Manage Volunteer Opportunities: Organization users can create, updated, and delete volunteer events</li>
    <li>Sign-Up: Volunteer users can sign for volunteer opportunities</li>
    <li>Search: Users can search for Volunteers, Events, or Organizations</li>
    <li>Authorization Security: User has 3 attempts to enter their password</li>
    <li>Review: Organizations and volunteers can review/endorse either volunteers or organizations/events (respectively)</li>
    <li>Auto-match: Volunteers can be auto-matched to (suggested) events based on specified profile information (skills, location, time available, etc.)</li>
</ul>
Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
<ul>
    <li>User Authentication/Authorization (Able to create account & login);</li>
    <li>Manage Volunteer Opportunities (Organization Users can create volunteer opportunities);</li>
